The site structure has been updated.

My content is now in the **_posts** directory, the **assets** directory and some template changes in the index.html file and the _layouts and _includes directories.

## Posts

Posts contain individual dynamic feature posts and 
static text posts.  In Posts, styles and scripts maybe inline in that page.

## Pages

Pages now have their own directory in assets.  This allows pages to use the **include_relative** template directive and have a subfolder of assets related to the page.

Pages are now listed in two sections on the index page, one for pages about the site and one for project pages.

### Project Pages

A project that is worked on for more than just a post worth of effort can now have it's own page.
